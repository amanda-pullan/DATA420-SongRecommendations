In this project, analysis was performed on large audio dataset using PySpark. Song recommendations were predicted for users based on their listening history. The data came from the Million Song Dataset (MSD), a project that was released by The Echo Nest and LabROSA in 2011. 

In particular, it focused on the following subsets:
- MSD AllMusic Genre Dataset (MAGD - genre labels)
- Taste Profile dataset (user-song plays)
- Audio Features dataset

This project was submitted as part of the DATA420-21S1 course at University of Canterbury. Some code has been adapted from that provided by the lecturer and is gratefully acknowledged.
